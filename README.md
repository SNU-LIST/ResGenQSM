# ResolutionGeneralizationForQSMNetwork

Matlab code for resolution-generalized inference of deep learning-based QSM methods<br/>

A_resample_data_for_inference.m: re-samples the input local field map to trained resolution at multiple spatial locations<br/>

B_Assemble_QSM_and_dipole_compensation.m: assembles the inferenced QSM maps to generate QSM map at input resolution<br/>
